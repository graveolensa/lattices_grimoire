lattices and automorphic forms grimoire

targets:
1. (tables of) phase portraits of theta series of lattices
2. phase portraits of other associated series of lattices (mock modular forms, Maass forms associated with Niemeier lattices)
3. Machine readable Gram matrices (in calcium?)
4. Quick color plots of Gram matrices
5. L-series associated to theta series of lattices
6. umbral and penumbral moonshine?
7. n-dimensional Euclidean Archimedian tilings
8. n-dimensional hyperbolic tilings (Patterson-Sullivan theory?)
9. to add (some questions about Maass forms)
10. to add (contents of the file I have about lattice-structures)
11. phase transition diagrams?
12. thin groups and sphere packings
